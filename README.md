## 📌 Project Overview

In a world increasingly threatened by pollution and climate change, the proper classification and disposal of garbage play a crucial role in sustainable urban living. This project titled “Garbage Classification Using AI and ML” focuses on building an intelligent system that automatically classifies different types of waste into predefined categories using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques.
The system aims to support smart waste management systems by minimizing human error and labor, encouraging recycling, and ensuring proper segregation of waste for treatment and disposal.
This project is part of a 4-week AICTE-certified internship under the Shell-Edunet Skill4Future Initiative, designed to enhance industry-relevant green skills and provide experiential learning under expert mentorship.
